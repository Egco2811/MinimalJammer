# MinimalJammer

This project is a minimal and portable implementation of FazJammer by William Afton and Antonio Martínez with a printed circuit board (PCB) and a Lithium Polymer (Li-Po) battery for power. The OLED display was removed in favor of three LEDs for idle, wifi and full attack modes. A fourth mode, stealth, was added to use the full attack mode without any lights on. A case measuring 88 x 63 x 24 mm encloses the board, battery and all the modules for portable use. 

## Requirements

- **NodeMCU ESP8266**
- **NRF24L01+** 2.4 GHz Module
- **1 Pin DIP Switch** For Turning the Device On
- **4 Pin 6x6 Push Button** For Switching Modes
- **Green Led**
- **Yellow Led**
- **Red Led**
- **3x 220Ω (or any sufficiently high resistance value) Resistors** For Limiting LED Currents
- **3.7 Volt Li-Po Battery Cell**
- **TP4056 Type-C Li-Po Charging Board with Out Pins**
- **2x M3x12 Hex Bolts**
- **A 3D Printer**

## Required Libraries

The following libraries must be installed in Arduino IDE:

- [RF24](https://github.com/nRF24/RF24)
- [ezButton](https://github.com/ArduinoGetStarted/button)

## Steps

1. **Manufacture PCB:** Use a manufacturing service (such as JLCPCB or PCBWay) to manufacture the PCBs.
2. **Solder the Components to the Board:** Source the required components using the Bill of Materials found in the project documents and solder each part according to the schematic.  
3. **Install libraries**: Use **Library Manager** in Arduino IDE to install the required libraries.
4. **Upload the code**: Open `jammer.ino` in Arduino IDE and upload it to your ESP8266 board.
5. **Print the Case**: Use the provided STEP or STL files to print the case and assemble with two M3x12 hex bolts.
7. **Power up the device**: Switch the device on using the DIP switch and use the push button to switch modes. 

## Usage

1. **Idle Mode:** Turns the Green LED on indicating its ready for user input. Nothing is transmitted.
2. **Wifi Attack Mode:** Turns the Yellow LED on indicating its jamming all wifi channels in the 2.4 GHz band.
3. **Full Attack Mode:** Turns the Red LED on indicating its jamming all channels including Bluetooth in the 2.4 GHz band.
4. **Stealth Attack Mode:** Turns the Red LED off while still jamming all channels in the 2.4 GHz band.
